                        Everything that constitutes olive oil is very beneficial to our bodies. Apart from being nutrient rich with MUFA, PUFA, vitamin E, Omega 3, Omega 6, polyphenols and anti oxidants, olive oil also aids in weight loss, healthy cholesterol levels and good cardio-circulatory system. Did you know that it takes about 5-8 kgs of olives to make just 1 litre of olive oil?

                        Olive oil is better as it has higher MUFA compared to any other oil. What's MUFA?

                    <div class="answer-wrap">
                        Monounsaturated fatty acids or MUFA are a healthy type of fat, and including more of this in your daily diet instead of saturated fats and trans fats may bring several health benefits. Olive, nuts and avocados, among others, are rich in MUFA. From lowering your risk of heart disease to improving the function of your blood vessels, MUFA (and PUFA) only brings good news and so does our olive oil!

                        Short for Poly-Unsaturated Fatty Acids, PUFA are essentially fat molecules that have more than one unsaturated carbon bond in the molecule. When consumed in moderation, PUFA are considered good for health.

                        Bertolli Extra Light Olive Oil is a perfect substitute for butter, ghee, vegetable and refined oils in Indian cooking. It does not overpower any dish with its taste and is excellent for high heat cooking, baking, sauteing and deep frying. The Classico variant here has a mild olive taste and is great for grilling, roasting, shallow frying and sauteing. The Extra Virgin variant is delicate and rich, and extracted by natural pressure with no chemicals or heat. This is great for soups, salads, dips and marinades, or just drizzling lightly over food.
